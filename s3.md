# 📦 AWS S3 Static Website Hosting - Project Documentation

## ✅ Objective:
Host a static HTML page on Amazon S3 and make it publicly accessible over the internet.

---

## 🛠️ Steps I Followed:

### 1. Created an S3 Bucket
- Logged into the AWS Console and navigated to **S3**.
- Clicked **Create Bucket**.
- Gave it a unique name like `arijit-static-site-bucket`.
- Chose the region (same as where other resources are, if any).
- **Unblocked public access** (important for static hosting).
- Left default options for other settings.

---

### 2. Uploaded My HTML File
- Uploaded `index.html` via **Upload** option inside the bucket.
- Made sure the file uploaded successfully.

---

### 3. Enabled Static Website Hosting
- Opened the bucket → **Properties** tab.
- Scrolled down to **Static Website Hosting**.
- Enabled it and added:
  - **Index document:** `index.html`
  - (Optional) **Error document:** `error.html`
- Copied the **Static Website Hosting Endpoint URL**.

---

### 4. Configured Bucket Policy for Public Access

Added the following policy under **Permissions > Bucket Policy**:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::arijit-static-site-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
