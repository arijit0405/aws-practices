# ‚öñÔ∏è AWS Load Balancers ‚Äì Overview

AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (like EC2, ECS, IPs, or Lambda functions) for high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

## üß© Types of AWS Load Balancers

| Load Balancer | Full Name               | Layer         | Use Case                             |
|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| ALB           | Application Load Balancer| Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS) | Web apps, REST APIs              |
| NLB           | Network Load Balancer    | Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)   | High-performance, low-latency apps |
| GWLB          | Gateway Load Balancer    | Layer 3/4 (IP)      | Security appliances like firewalls, IPS/IDS |

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### ‚úÖ Best For:
- HTTP/HTTPS web traffic
- Microservices / Containers
- Routing based on content

### üí° Features:
- Layer 7 (Application Layer)
- Path-based routing (e.g., `/api` ‚Üí service A, `/user` ‚Üí service B)
- Host-based routing (e.g., `api.example.com` ‚Üí service)
- WebSocket support
- Integrates with ECS, EKS, Lambda

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Network Load Balancer (NLB)

### ‚úÖ Best For:
- Ultra-fast performance
- TCP/UDP traffic
- Real-time apps or low latency needs

### üí° Features:
- Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
- Handles millions of requests per second
- Preserves the source IP address
- Works with static IP addresses or Elastic IPs

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

### ‚úÖ Best For:
- Deploying and scaling security appliances
- Centralizing third-party tools (firewalls, traffic inspection, etc.)

### üí° Features:
- Operates at Layer 3/4
- Routes traffic to virtual appliances using GENEVE encapsulation
- Great for centralized security architectures

| Sticky Sessions        | Supported (via cookies) | Not supported     | Not applicable                |
| SSL Termination        | Supported         | Supported         | Not applicable                |
| Source IP Preservation | Not preserved     | Preserved         | Preserved                     |
| Pricing                | Medium            | Low               | Higher (due to complexity)    |
| WebSocket Support      | ‚úÖ                | ‚ùå                | ‚ùå                            |

## üõ†Ô∏è When to Use What?

| Scenario                                | Use This |
|-----------------------------------------|----------|
| You need advanced request routing (path/host) | ALB      |
| Your app requires ultra-low latency     | NLB      |
| You need to deploy firewalls/security appliances | GWLB     |
| You're using containers (ECS/EKS)       | ALB or NLB |
| You want to inspect or filter traffic   | GWLB     |

## üîó Common Integrations

| Service         | Load Balancer    |
